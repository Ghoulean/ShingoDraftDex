I'm abandoning this project

1. After fixing the "MDX not actually being parsed as MDX" issue, Gatsby has been throwing out-of-memory errors at only ~1000 pages, even with 8 GB RAM. This is problematic as the plan of this website was to expand on more generations. I see no fix other than stop using Gatsby and switch to Nextjs or something
2. Apparently Smogon and draft league are doing some kind of website merge, rendering this project obsolete as I am not involved with draft league enough to write and/or source the article contents myself
